# optimized-Mat-Mul-cuda-code
The provided code is a Python script that uses the CuPy library to perform optimized GPU operations, specifically matrix multiplication. The script includes a custom CUDA kernel that is optimized for performance and energy consumption. The kernel uses half-precision floating-point numbers (float16) for improved performance and warp utilization.
