# Optimized Matrix Multiplication CUDA code.
The provided code is a Python script that uses the CuPy library to perform optimized GPU operations, specifically matrix multiplication. The script includes a custom CUDA kernel that is optimized for performance and energy consumption. The kernel uses half-precision floating-point numbers (float16) for improved performance and warp utilization.
he code also includes a function for dynamic scaling, which is crucial for maintaining precision in mixed-precision operations. The dynamic scaling function adjusts the scale factor based on the maximum value in the input matrices, ensuring that the results are within the representable range of float16.

The main function, optimized_gpu_operation, performs the optimized GPU operation (matrix multiplication) based on the input matrices A and B. It supports both forward and backward passes. The function returns the result matrix C.

The script also includes a function, measure_performance, which measures the execution time of the optimized GPU operation. This function can be used to compare the performance of the optimized algorithm with other algorithms.

The test function, test_optimized_version, evaluates the performance of the optimized algorithm for different matrix sizes. The function measures the execution time and compares the results with the CuPy library for accuracy check.
